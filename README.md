# Thea: AI Therapist in Python

Welcome to Thea, your virtual companion on the path to emotional well-being! Thea is an artificial intelligence therapist implemented in Python, designed to simulate the empathetic and understanding qualities of a real-life therapist. With a focus on continuous learning and personalized interactions, Thea aims to create a supportive environment for users seeking emotional guidance.

## Compatibility

**Windows only** due to an oversight while making the project using **pyttsx3**, which relies on **pywin32**, a package available only on Windows. The Thea development team is actively working to improve cross-platform compatibility by adopting a more OS-friendly package. Expect this update approximately three releases after version 0.1.0.

## Disclaimer

Before proceeding, it is crucial to note that **Thea is an AI therapist designed to provide support and companionship. However, it is not a substitute for professional mental health care.** If you are experiencing severe distress or have suicidal thoughts, please seek immediate help from a mental health professional or contact a helpline in your region.

The **Thea development team emphasizes** that while Thea aims to be supportive, **it is not a licensed therapist.** The AI is continually learning and evolving, and your feedback is valuable for its improvement. **The Thea team does not take responsibility for any harm caused by the program; use it at your own risk.**

## Features

- **Dynamic Learning:** Thea evolves over time, learning from user interactions to enhance the quality of responses.

- **Natural Language Processing:** Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, Thea engages in natural and meaningful conversations with users.

- **Empathetic Interaction:** Thea's goal is to provide a human-like therapeutic experience, offering support and understanding.
